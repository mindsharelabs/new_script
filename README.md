Bash shell script template generator

==========

This is a shell script template generator (i.e. a script that writes scripts). It is used to create the boilerplate portions of a shell script. It asks the user a series of questions about the script to be generated and then writes the resulting script to a file. Scripts generated with new_script include error and signal handling routines, a command-line option and argument parser, and basic command-line help.
